Did a few technical posts on CodeForces a couple of years back on some competitive programming techniques. Here are the links:

- [Tutorial on FFT/NTT — The tough made simple.(Part 2)](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/48798)
- [Tutorial on Zeta Transform, Mobius Transform and Subset Sum Convolution](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/72488)

Aggregating them here to keep all my posts in one place.
